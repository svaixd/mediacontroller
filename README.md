Assignment4 Media Controller

Use the skills you have learned so far in our class to make a simple controller on a breadboard. This controller (pot, buttons, FSR, etc) should control a Processing sketch. 

 

You should submit a short video clip or URL to a video clip that shows your breadboard and the Processing sketch working on your screen.
